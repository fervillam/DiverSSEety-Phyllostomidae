# Testing the sensibility of SSE models to different types of character codification
Welcome! I'm going to test if SSE processes are sensible to different types of character codification. I'll use a Phyllostomidae pruned phylogeny taken from Upham et al. (2019).

I used BiSSE, MuSSE and HiSSE in order to test this. I expect that all results, independent of character codification, will show the same ancestral diet.
